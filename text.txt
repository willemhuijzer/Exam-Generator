Question 1:
What are the primary features used to distinguish different forms of parameter control in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. What component of the EA is changed and how the change is made
B. Evidence/data backing up changes and level/scope of change
C. What component is controlled and how the evidence is gathered
D. None of the above

Answer: A

Question 2:
What is the purpose of parameter control in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. To delegate the problem solving task to the evolutionary process
B. To reduce the required computing resources
C. To increase user control over the search process
D. To use appropriate parameter values in various stages of the search

Answer: D

Question 3:
What are the three major types of parameter control in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. Deterministic, adaptive, and induced
B. Deterministic, adaptive, and self-adaptive
C. Adaptive, random, and self-adaptive
D. Adaptive, self-adaptive, and induced

Answer: B

Question 4:
What is the difference between deterministic and adaptive parameter control in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. Deterministic control is based on feedback from the search progress, while adaptive control follows a predefined rule
B. Deterministic control follows a predefined rule, while adaptive control is based on feedback from the search progress
C. Deterministic control changes the entire population, while adaptive control only changes selected individuals
D. Deterministic control changes the problem definition, while adaptive control changes the search strategy

Answer: B

Question 5:
What is the potential disadvantage of self-adaptive parameter control in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. Increased user workload in parameter tuning
B. Reduced ability to delegate parameter setting task to the evolutionary process
C. Increased overhead due to double task of problem solving and self-calibrating
D. None of the above

Answer: C
