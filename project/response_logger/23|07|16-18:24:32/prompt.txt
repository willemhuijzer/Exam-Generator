• Tuning
• Control
• Examples
• Extended / refined taxonomy
• Some figures about related workMotivation (1/2)
An EA has many strategy parameters, e.g.
• mutation operator and mutation rate
• crossover operator and crossover rate
• selection mechanism and selective pressure (e.g. tournament size)
• population size
Good parameter values facilitate good performance
Q1 How to find good parameter values ?Motivation (2/2)
EA parameters are rigid (values constant during a run)
BUT
an EA is a dynamic, adaptive process
THUS
optimal parameter values may vary during a run
Q2: How to vary parameter values?Parameter SettingVarying mutation step size
Task to solve:
• min f(x ,…,x )
1 n
• L <= x <= U for i = 1,…,n bounds
i i i
• g (x) ≠ 0 for i = 1,…,q inequality constraints
i
• h (x) = 0 for i = q+1,…,m equality constraints

Algorithm:
• EA with real-valued representation (x ,…,x )

• arithmetic averaging crossover
• Gaussian mutation: x’ = x + N(0, σ)
i i
• standard deviation σ is called mutation step sizeVarying mutation step size, option 1
Replace the constant σ by a function σ (t)
t
σ (t)= 1 - 0. 9 ×
T
0 < t <= T is the current generation number
Features:
• changes in σ are independent from the search progress
• strong user control of σ by the above formula
• σ is fully predictable
• a given σ acts on all individuals of the populationVarying mutation step size, option 2
Replace the constant σ by a function σ(t) updated after every n steps by the 1/5
success rule, where p is the % of successful mutations:
s
ìs(t - n)/ c if p >0.2
s
ï
s(t)= s(t - n)×c if p <0.2
í

ï
s(t - n) otherwise

Features:
• changes in σ are based on feedback from the search progress
• some user control of σ by the above formula
• σ is not predictable
• a given σ acts on all individuals of the populationVarying mutation step size, option 3
• Assign a personal σ to each individual
• Incorporate this σ into the chromosome: (x , …, x , σ)

are handled by penalties:
eval(x) = f(x) + W × penalty(x)
m ì1 for violated constraint
å

0 for satisfied constraint
î
j=1Varying penalties, option 1
Replace the constant W by a function W(t)
α
W(t) = ( C ´ t)
0 < t <= T is the current generation number
Features:
• changes in W independently from the search progress
• strong user control of W by the above formula
• W is fully predictable
• a given W acts on all individuals of the populationVarying penalties, option 2
Replace the constant W by W(t) updated in each generation
ì b´W(t) if last k champions all feasible
ï
W(t +1)= g´W(t) if last k champions all infeasible
í
ï
W(t) otherwise
î
b < 1, g > 1, b ´ g ¹ 1, champion: best of its generation
Features:
• changes in W are based on feedback from the search progress
• some user control of W by the above formula
• W is not predictable
• a given W acts on all individuals of the populationVarying penalties, option 3
Assign a personal W to each individual
Incorporate this W into the chromosome: (x , …, x , W)
1 n
Apply variation operators to x ‘s and W
i
Alert:
eval ((x, W)) = f (x) + W × penalty(x)
while for mutation step sizes we had
eval ((x, σ)) = f (x)
this option is thus sensitive “cheating” & makes no senseLessons learned (1/2)
Various forms of parameter control can be distinguished by:
• primary features:
• what component of the EA is changed
• how the change is made
• secondary features:
• evidence/data backing up changes
• level/scope of changeWhat component is controlled
Practically any EA component can be parameterized and thus controlled on-the-fly:
• representation
• evaluation function
• variation operators
• selection operator (parent or mating selection)
• replacement operator (survival or environmental selection)
• population (size, topology)How are parameters controlled
Three major types of parameter control:
• deterministic: some rule modifies strategy parameter without feedback from the
search (based on some counter)
• adaptive: feedback rule based on some measure monitoring search progress
• self-adaptative: parameter values evolve along with solutions; encoded onto
chromosomes they undergo variation and selectionGlobal taxonomy – now well-founded JEvidence: Informing the change (1/2)
The parameter changes may be based on:
• time or nr. of evaluations (deterministic control)
• population statistics (adaptive control)
• progress made
• population diversity
• gene distribution, etc.
• relative fitness of individuals created with given values (adaptive or self-adaptive
control)Evidence: Informing the change (2/2)
• Absolute evidence: predefined event triggers change, e.g. increase p by 10% if
m
population diversity falls under threshold x
• Direction and magnitude of change is fixed
• Relative evidence: compare values through solutions created with them, e.g.
increase p by x% if top x% offspring came by high mutation rates, decrease
m
otherwise
• Direction and magnitude of change is not fixedEvidence: Refined taxonomy
Combinations of types and evidences
•
Possible: +
•
Impossible: -
•Scope/level
The parameter may take effect on different levels:
• environment (fitness function)
• population
• individual
• sub-individual
Note: given component (parameter) determines
possibilities
Thus: scope/level is a derived or secondary feature in the
classification schemeLessons learned (2/2)
Various forms of parameter control can be distinguished by:
σ(t) = 1-0.9*t/T σ' = σ/c, (x 1, ..., x n, σ) (x 1, …, x n, σ 1, …, σ n) W(t) = (C*t)α W'=β*W, if b i∈F (x 1, ..., x n, W)

• Parameter control offers the possibility to use appropriate values in various stages of
the search
• Adaptive and self-adaptive parameter control
• offer users “liberation” from parameter tuning
• delegate parameter setting task to the evolutionary process
• the latter implies a double task for an EA: problem solving + self-calibrating (overhead)Publications per category overview
