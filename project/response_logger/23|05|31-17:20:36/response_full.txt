        "content": "Question 1: Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of which of the following fields?\nA. Computer science\nB. Biology\nC. Physics\nD. Mathematics\n\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion 2: What is the meaning of the term \"compositional\" when referring to natural language?\nA. The meaning of a whole expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and the manner in which they are put together\nB. The choice of words to describe someone are quite arbitrary\nC. New words are created at all times\nD. We can talk about things that are not here or do not exist\n\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion 3: Which of the following models is NOT combined in NLP to enable computers to understand human language?\nA. Statistical models\nB. Computational linguistics\nC. Deep learning models\nD. Quantum computing models\n\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion 4: What is the main challenge with non-probabilistic methods in NLP?\nA. They are too complex\nB. They are too slow\nC. They return all possible analyses, making it difficult to identify the best possible analysis\nD. They are not accurate\n\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion 5: What is Zipf's law?\nA. A law that explains how computers understand human language\nB. A law that explains how robots learn\nC. A law that explains how humans create language\nD. A law that explains the frequency of words in a language\n\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion 6: Which of the following best describes the concept of \"variation\" in NLP?\nA. The fact that one form can have different meanings\nB. The fact that NLP requires lots of data about any particular phenomenon\nC. The fact that correct interpretation is context-dependent and often requires world knowledge\nD. The fact that new words are created at all times\n\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion 7: What is the main challenge with estimating probabilities for rare or unseen words in NLP?\nA. The need for more computing resources\nB. The need for more time\nC. Sparse data due to Zipf's law\nD. Context dependence\n\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion 8: Why is it important to use different speech taggers for different types of language use?\nA. Because it increases user control\nB. Because it improves predictability of parameter values\nC. Because variation is a challenge in NLP\nD. Because the language use is way too different\n\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion 9: How is natural language often used?\nA. In written form only\nB. In spoken form only\nC. As a combination of both spoken and written forms\nD. None of the above\n\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion 10: What is the main challenge with capturing context dependence in NLP?\nA. The need for more computing resources\nB. The need for more time\nC. It requires world knowledge\nD. Sparse data due to Zipf's law\n\nAnswer: C",
