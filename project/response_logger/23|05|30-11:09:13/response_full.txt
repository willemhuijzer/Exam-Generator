Descriptive linguistics describes how language should be used, while prescriptive linguistics describes how language is actually used\nB. Descriptive linguistics describes how language is actually used, while prescriptive linguistics describes how language should be used\nC. Descriptive linguistics studies only the syntax of language, while prescriptive linguistics studies only the meaning of language\nD. Descriptive linguistics studies the origin of language, while prescriptive linguistics studies the evolution of language over time\n\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion 10:\nWhat is the advantage of testing a model\u2019s latent space in NLP?\nA. It can be used to introduce new words to the model\nB. It provides a way to simplify models of neural networks\nC. It allows us to precisely control the values of model parameters\nD. It helps us understand whether the model encodes structural information\n\nAnswer: D",
