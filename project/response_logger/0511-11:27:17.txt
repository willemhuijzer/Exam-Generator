Question 1:
Why do optimal parameter values in Evolutionary Algorithms vary during a run?
A. Because EA parameters are rigid and do not adapt to changes
B. Because EA parameters are dynamic and adaptive to changes
C. Because EA parameters are based on user preferences only
D. Because EA parameters are not important for the success of the search

Answer: B

Question 2:
What is the purpose of parameter setting in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. To control the population size
B. To choose the best variation operators
C. To find the best parameter values for each component
D. To reduce the computational cost of the algorithm

Answer: C

Question 3:
Which of the following is a feature of varying mutation step sizes in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. Changes in σ are based on user feedback
B. A given σ acts on only one individual
C. σ is fully predictable in all cases
D. The same σ acts on all individuals of the population

Answer: D

Question 4:
What is the difference between absolute and relative evidence for parameter control in Evolutionary Algorithms?
A. Absolute evidence is based on predefined event triggers, while relative evidence is based on comparing values through solutions created with them
B. Absolute evidence is not fixed, while relative evidence has a fixed direction and magnitude of change
C. Absolute evidence is based on fitness function changes, while relative evidence is based on population diversity
D. Absolute evidence is determined by secondary features, while relative evidence is determined by primary features

Answer: A

Question 5:

B. Population
C. Individual
D. Problem size
