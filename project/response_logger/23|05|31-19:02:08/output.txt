Question 6: What is Zipfâ€™s law?
A. A law that prohibits the use of zero-frequency words in NLP
B. A law that states the more frequent a word is in a corpus, the less frequent its rank 
C. A law that states the more frequent a word is in a corpus, the more frequent its rank
D. A law that states the more frequent a word is in a corpus, the more similar its forms

Question 7: Which type of method returns all possible analyses in NLP?
A. Non-probabilistic methods 
B. Probabilistic models 
C. Machine learning algorithms 
D. Rule-based models 

Answer: A 

Question 8: What is the challenge in NLP due to context dependence?
A. It requires lots of data about any particular phenomenon
B. It often requires world knowledge that is difficult to capture 
C. It returns all possible analyses instead of the best possible analysis 
D. It requires finding clever ways to estimate probabilities for things we have rarely or never seen 

Answer: B 

Question 9: What is the challenge in NLP due to expressivity?
A. One form can have different meanings, but the same meaning can also be expressed with different forms
B. It requires finding clever ways to estimate probabilities for things we have rarely or never seen 
C. The language use is way too different across different platforms 
D. It typically requires more computing resources than non-NLP algorithms 

Answer: A 

Question 10: What is the challenge in NLP due to variation?
A. It often requires world knowledge that is difficult to capture 
B. One form can have different meanings, but the same meaning can also be expressed with different forms
C. The choice of words to describe someone is arbitrary 
D. Correct interpretation is context-dependent 

Answer: B
